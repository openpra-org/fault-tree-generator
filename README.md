# PRA Model Generator

This repository includes Probabilistic Risk Assessment (PRA) model generation source code,
schema for different model format, and additional scripts to automate model generation.

## 1. OpenPSA Model Exchange Format 
The [OpenPSA Model Exchange Format (MEF)](https://open-psa.github.io/mef/index.html) 
represents about a decade of effort to develop a format independent of any specific 
quantification engine. The goal was to create a standard that researchers, corporations, and regulators could use collaboratively in an open environment.

## 2. SAPHSOLVE Model Format 
SAPHSOLVE is the quantification engine of legacy PRA tool SAPHIRE. SAPHSOLVE input and output format are detailed in a [report](https://www.osti.gov/biblio/2203095) published by Idaho National Laboratory.
